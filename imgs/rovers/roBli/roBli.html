remain slack under all circumstances during the competition. All the wires coming out of
the machine should be stacked as a single unit.
Improper wiring may lead to direct
disqualification even before the event.</li>
<li> Use of IC (Internal Combustion) Engines are
prohibited.</li>
<li> If the judges consider that a robot runs
high risk of damaging or ruining the arena, they
will not permit it to run.</li>
<li> No fans & weaponries can be used in the
